This repo is empty as I left GitHub when it was purchased by MS.

However, this readme will contain links to self-hosted Git, where this repo will exist and will contain;

1. Replacement system tables for Amazon Redshift (including installer, uninstaller, test suite, and *completely* comprehensive documentation).
2. HTML/PDFs of numerous investigations into Redshift sub-systems.

As of 2024-07-29, I am in the process of writing the code and setting up the various repos/git/etc, and will update this readme when it's all good to go.
