This repo is empty as I left GitHub when it was purchased by MS.

However, this readme provides below a link to the Redshift Observatory Replacement Systems Tables page, providing the SQL file installer and the PDF and HTML docs.

Currently, there are about 780 views, but they are organized; you'll ignore those which don't matter.
