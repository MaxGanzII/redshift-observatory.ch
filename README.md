This repo is empty as I left GitHub when it was purchased by MS.

However, this readme will contain links to my self-hosted Git, where this repo contains;

1. Replacement system tables for Amazon Redshift (include the installer, test suite, and completely comprehensive documentation).  These are wholly my work and are unified and coherent, and so not a disparate collection of whatevers from all and sundry.
2. HTML/PDFs of numerous investigations into Redshift sub-systems.

As of 2024-07-29, I am in the process of setting up the various repos/git/etc, and will update this readme when it's all good to go.
